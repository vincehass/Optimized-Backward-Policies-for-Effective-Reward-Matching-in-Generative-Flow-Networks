### Task 4: BAG Generation Task

#### Dataset Properties and Goal

- **Properties**: The BAG generation task involves creating a set of items of different types, with a maximum capacity of 15 items in each bag. There are seven possible item types that can be included in a bag. If a bag contains **seven or more repeats of any item**, it receives a reward of **10** with a **75% probability** or **30** otherwise.
- **Goal**: Train a GFlowNet to generate bags that maximize the reward function by effectively managing the type and count of items. The threshold for determining the mode is **30**.
- **Exploration-Exploitation**: OBP-GFN needs to explore different combinations of item types to understand the effects of item repetition on reward while exploiting the configurations that lead to higher rewards.

    def generate_bag(self):
        # Randomly generate items for a bag with a max capacity
        num_items = random.randint(1, self.max_capacity)
        return [random.choice(self.item_types) for _ in range(num_items)]

    def calculate_reward(self, bag):
        score = 0
        reasoning = []

        # Count occurrences of each item type
        item_counts = {item: bag.count(item) for item in self.item_types}
        high_count_items = [item for item, count in item_counts.items() if count >= 7]

        if high_count_items:
            # If any item type has 7 or more occurrences, reward is either 10 or 30
            reward = 30 if random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.75 else 10
            score += reward
            reasoning.append(f"High repetition of {high_count_items}: Reward = {reward}")
        else:
            reasoning.append("No item type has 7 or more occurrences.")

    def save_dataset(self, filename, num_samples=1000):
        dataset = self.generate_dataset(num_samples)
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(dataset, f, indent=2)
        print(f"Dataset saved to {filename}")

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bag_gen = BagGeneration()
    bag_gen.save_dataset("bag_generation_enhanced_dataset.json", num_samples=1000)

    # Print a few examples

        print("Reasoning:")
        for reason in item['reasoning']:
            print(f"- {reason}")
        print()
```

#### Explanation

1. **Dataset Generation**:

   - **Bag Creation**: The bags are generated with a random number of items, up to the maximum capacity of 15. Each item can be one of the 7 types available.
   - **Reward Calculation**: The reward is determined based on the repetition of items:
     - If a bag contains 7 or more of the same item, it receives either **10** or **30** points, depending on a probabilistic threshold (75% chance of receiving 10).
   - This probabilistic reward encourages exploration during training, as not all high-repetition bags yield the highest possible reward.

2. **Exploration-Exploitation in BAG Generation**:

   - **Exploration**: OBP-GFN needs to explore combinations of item counts and types to determine which configurations maximize the reward.
   - **Exploitation**: As the model learns, it will exploit the configurations that are more likely to yield a reward of **30** based on repetition patterns.

3. **Script Features**:
   - The script generates a dataset containing **bags** of items, **scores**, and detailed **reasoning** for the assigned reward.
   - Each sample bag includes the items contained, the assigned score, and the reason for that score, making the dataset suitable for training a GFlowNet to learn effective reward maximization strategies for the BAG generation task.

#### Summary of All Enhanced Tasks
